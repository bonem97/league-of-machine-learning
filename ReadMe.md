# League of Machine Learning

Group project using machine learning to create a predictive model for determining the outcome of the popular online videogame 'League of Legends' based on game data aquired 10 minutes in. Uses Python, SQL, and JavaScript. When a League of Legends username is entered into the field on the "Using the Machine" tab, the data of that user's most recently played game will be aquired through the Riot API and the model will make a prediction about the result based on the data 10 minutes in.
